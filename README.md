# Learning Objectives:

* working in the terminal
* cloning a repository from GitHub
* reading TypeScript/JSX and see what that code produces
* editing lines of code where instructed to do so
 
This React app is a manipulatable tool to aid in the learning of TypeScript/JSX/JavaScript components. The goal is to tinker with the app to see how one line of code affects what we see on our phones, as well as begin to understand the cloning/coding process on GitHub. Below are concrete steps to begin this activity. 

1. scroll to the top of the "KatSMTemplate" repository page and locate the green dropdown button that says "code"
2. when you click "code" you will see a URL: https://github.com/kfreeman000/KatSMTemplate.git. press the square to the right of the URL to copy it.
3. open visual studio code on your machine
4. on the welcome page, click "clone git repository"
5. paste the URL in that textbox.
